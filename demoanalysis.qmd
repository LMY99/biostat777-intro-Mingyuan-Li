We hereby analyze the dataset **mtcars**, which contains data extracted from 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine containing fuel consumption and aspects of automobile design and performace for 32 automobiles.

-   **The question we aim to answer:** We aim to find the relationship between the fuel consumption of cars, measured with **miles per US Gallon(MPG)**, and the design of automobiles.

::: {.callout-tip}
Note that larger values of miles per gallon indicates lower consumption of fuel over the same distance. The inverse of that value can be regarded as the fuel efficiency of the automobiles.
:::

-   **Intended Audience:** This analysis is meant for statisticians as well as people interested in automobiles.

-   **Data Source:** The dataset is extracted from 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine containing fuel consumption and aspects of automobile design and performace for 32 automobiles. It is available in the **datasets** package which is a built-in package in **R** programming language. A reference to the data is *Henderson and Velleman (1981), Building multiple regression models interactively.

::: {.callout-note}
We can see that fewer cylinders are associated with both lower displacement, lower weight, higher MPG and lower gross horsepower. So cylinder number is a confounder since it relates with both the outcome of interest(in this case, MPG) and other independent variables, and a reasonable thing to do is to include cylinder number into statistical models.

- **Statistical Modelling:**

We now fit a linear model to find the relationship between MPG and other characteristics of automobiles, and then attempt to select a subset of variables by stepwise selection[@Stepwise], in order to simplify the model without losing too much accuracy. Akaike's Information Criteria is used to represent the model's accuracy while penalizing more complex models.
```{r}
model <- lm(mpg~., mtcars_df)
summary(model)
model_step <- step(model)
knitr::kable(model_step$anova)
# Fit the simplified subset model 
summary(lm(mpg~weight+qsec+transmission,mtcars_df))
```
::: {.callout-note}
From the model, we see that only weight appears weakly significant(we use "weakly" since common choices of significance level is 0.05 or lower) and other variables all appear non-significant. But after using stepwise selection, everything except weight, qsec and transmission is removed one by one, making the rest of the variables all significant. And note that the simplified model explained 85\% of the variability in MPG, whereas the full model explained 87\%, which is not really a big loss in accuracy.
:::

- **Summary:**

Exploratory analysis showed that manual transmission, straight engines and smaller number of cylinders are associated with higher MPG and thus lower fuel consumption. 
The graph of the data suggests correlation among MPG, cylinder numbers and other variables, suggesting strong confounding in the data. 
After fitting the linear model and performing variable selection, weight, quarter-mile time and transmission type remained as the significant predictors. 
When other variables are fixed, for any 1000 pounds increased in weight, MPG decreases by 3.9 by average. 
Cars with manual transmission traverses 2.94 miles per gallon more than those with automatic transmission with other characteristics being the same. 
Any unit increase in quarter-mile time is associated with 1.22 increase in MPG when weight and transmissions are fixed.
